Home work â„–4
Asynchronous work with the Network and DB

Extend the main, to execute the full program cycle
(add the async_main invocation):
- creating tables (initialization)
- load users and posts
    - the post and users data should be loaded simultaneously
      with asyncio.gather (https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#running-tasks-concurrently)
- add users and posts into the DB
  (using the data obtained from request relay them to a function to save in the DB)
- terminate the connection to the DB
